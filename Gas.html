</h1>
</center>
<h3>
Gas is one of four natural states of matter, along with liquid, solid and plasma. A gas has no fixed shape or volume. The atoms or molecules that make up the gas fill the container that holds them. The gas expands until it is uniformly distributed throughout the container, even in the presence of gravity.A gas is a substance that is in a gaseous, or vaporous, state of matter. The term gas is also used in reference to the state itself when applied to matter that has the properties of a gaseous substance. Gas is one of four natural states of matter, along with liquid, solid and plasma.

A gas has no fixed shape or volume. The atoms or molecules that make up the gas fill the container that holds them. The gas expands until it is uniformly distributed throughout the container, even in the presence of gravity. If not confined to a container, a gas disperses into space.
